Fast Debugger (ruby-debug-ide 0.4.16, ruby-debug-base 0.10.4) listens on 127.0.0.1:39767
[DEVISE] From version 1.2, there is no need to set your encryptor to bcrypt since encryptors are only enabled if you include :encryptable in your models. To update your app, please:

1) Remove config.encryptor from your initializer;
2) Add t.encryptable to your old migrations;
3) [Optional] Remove password_salt in a new recent migration. Bcrypt does not require it anymore.
