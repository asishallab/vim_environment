Notes:
Take a look at the file align.vim. It contains two different ways of matching
letters in a DNA sequence. Both are relatively slow on large files, but one is
slower than the other. For the second (slowest) alternative, please note that
unless taxon names are written at the very start of the line (no preceding
white space), letters are also highlighted in the names. That is, the
highlighting works optimally on a file with the following format:

taxon_1 ACGT
taxon_2 ACGT
...
taxon_n ACGT


If your buffers automatically do text wrapping, use
 :set wrap!
to get a nicer view.


Installation:
1.	Put the align.vim in your ~/.vim/syntax folder
2.	To set the filetype to align do
		:set filetype=align
		:syntax enable
